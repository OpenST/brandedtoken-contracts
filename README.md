OpenST blockchain infrastructure empowers new economies for mainstream businesses and emerging (D)Apps. The token and other smart contracts in this repository are intended for use with the OpenST Protocol, a framework for tokenizing businesses.

_While this software is available as-is for anyone to use, we caution that this is in early stage and under heavy ongoing development and improvement. Please report bugs and suggested improvements._

## OpenST Tokens

Utility Branded Tokens and Value Branded Tokens form the basis of token economies built with the OpenST Protocol.

For more information on the OpenST Protocol, please consult the [Whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwgf8QuAEOb7Z2xIeUlLd21DSjQ/view).
